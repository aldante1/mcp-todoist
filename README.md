## Setup

### Getting a Todoist API Token
1. Log in to your Todoist account
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Integrations
3. Find your API token under "Developer"

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "todoist": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-todoist/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TODOIST_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Project & Section Setup
```
"Show me all my projects"
"Create a new project called 'Work Tasks'"
"Create a section called 'In Progress' in project 12345"
"Show me sections in the Work Tasks project"
```

### Task Creation & Management
```
"Create task 'Team Meeting' in project 12345"
"Add task 'Review PR' due tomorrow with labels ['Code Review', 'Urgent']"
"Create high priority task with deadline 2024-12-25"
"Update meeting task to be in section 67890"
"Mark the PR review task as complete"
```

### Task Discovery
```
"Show all my tasks"
"List high priority tasks due this week"
"Get tasks in project 12345"
```

## Workflow

1. **Discover Projects**: Use "Todoist Project Get" to see available projects
2. **Create Organization**: Use "Todoist Project Create" and "Todoist Section Create" as needed
3. **Manage Tasks**: Create, update, and organize tasks using project/section IDs
4. **Track Progress**: Use task filtering and completion tools

The codebase is organized into focused modules:

- **`src/index.ts`**: Main server entry point with request routing
- **`src/handlers/`**: Business logic separated by domain (tasks, projects)
- **`src/types.ts`**: TypeScript type definitions
- **`src/type-guards.ts`**: Runtime type validation
- **`src/validation.ts`**: Input validation and sanitization
- **`src/errors.ts`**: Custom error types with structured handling
- **`src/cache.ts`**: In-memory caching for performance optimization
- **`src/tools.ts`**: MCP tool definitions and schemas
